We want to transform the way the grocery industry has been doing business and create the next wave of digital transformation in the grocery industry. </p> </div> </div> <div class="card"> <div class="wdw"></div> <div class="card-head"> <h4>Why do we do this? </h4> </div> <div class="card-content"> <p> The success of the e-commerce giants lies in their ability to make informed decisions. We thought why not give that superpower to the ordinary retailer community? With more power in their hands, they can tend to their customers needs more carefully and can invest in their inventories with more confidence. We respect the contribution of traditional grocers towards the economy and we want to aid them to maximize their contribution. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section id="team" class="team gen"> <div class="container"> <h3>Team</h3> <div class="wrapper"> <div class="card-team"> <div class="clip-path"></div> <div class="image-sec"> <img src="assets/gokul.jpg" alt="Gokul"/> </div> <div class="content"> <span class="name">Gokul Santhosh</span> <span class="pos">Co-founder</span> <p> Gokul is a storyteller by heart.
