Smoke, Heavy head, Lights.

Cough, breathe, repeat!

Blurry vision and weightless body.

Seeing life as if in a Cinema.

Echoing sounds and blurry vision.

Focused and unfocused at the same time,

He ran, not really. But he did anyway.

Where to? He didn’t knew.

Why? Because he could.

Mind couldn’t catch up with his thoughts.

Cough,breathe, repeat!

Animated life.

Life!

“What does it mean?” He asked.

“Does it matter?”

Nope, it doesn’t!

Run, fly, walk, breathe!

Forget about life and focus on living.
