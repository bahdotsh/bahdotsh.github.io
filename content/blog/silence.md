Can you hear it, the sound the sunlight make when it first hits the ground? Or the sound the raindrops make, when they gently kiss your forehead? Can’t you hear it, the sound darkness make, as it gently floods the dusk? Yes, you can! All you have to do is listen. Close your eyes and listen. And as you listen, notice that your heart is surprisingly in rhythm with this beautiful music of silence. Intoxicating, isn’t? Now go ahead and set the tempo. Dance around and smile. Don’t be afraid, of falling out of rhythm, because you are the one who sets it.
