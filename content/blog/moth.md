Nobody knows why,

why I follow the light

People think I crave it

They think I’m afraid of the darkness

And that I will die without it

But no,

I love darkness

It never hurts you

Nothing’s as peaceful as darkness,

as silent as it is,

And nobody as great a listener.

Wait, let’s stick to the actual question.

Why I go to the light when I love darkness so much

Well, haven’t you noticed?

The light’s always alone.

It’s always angry.

Screaming its anger at the world.

And every time I kiss the light,

it screams a little less.

It calms down.

And one day I’m sure

I will save it

From all it’s miseries

I will take away the pain from the light

And make it happy

Like how darkness always is
