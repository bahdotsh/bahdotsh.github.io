“And they lived happily ever after”

The story ended.

The thought didn’t.

“Happily ever after”!

The thought echoed.

Did the author had a typo?

Did he forget to put a question mark at the end?

Does happiness last for ever?

Maybe happiness is for royalty.

How can a hungry stomach be happy?

How can a thirsty mouth smile?

Hunger made him hate food and

Thirst made him hate water.

There was no happiness in his world.

Hate defined his life.

His wandering mind was suddenly at peace

his hungry stomached stopped growling at him,

his thirsty mouth sealed shut,

his tired eyes stopped blinking.

And as he saw her smile

He knew

Love was the answer.
